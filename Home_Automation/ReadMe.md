### HomeAutomation 
The main aim of our project is to make the home smarter using differnet technologies by interfacing required peripherals. Itâ€™s a combination of Embedded Systems and IOT technologies.

### Systems Involved
1. Main Door System
2. Temperature & Humidity Display
3. LEDs Controlling System
4. Water Level Indicator System

All the required peripheral devices are embedded with two Arduino UNOs, one Nano & one ESP8266 developement modules accordingly.

We had designed 5 rooms of different sizes (Hall, Kitchen, Bedroom, Garage & Bathroom) also given a free space as a garden area. Every room was equipped with different color LEDs each.

As it was a very complicated project of interfacing all the required peripherals devices at a single project, we organized accordingly to ensure a perfect execution without any mislead towards our projects and referred majority of the official sites for establishing more ideas.

To accomplish this project without any errors, we planned & executed our ideas in a manner that no one is going to have a question for asking us related to the mistakes that we did in the field.
